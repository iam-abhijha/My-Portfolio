            You can also call me a Front-end, Android App, WordPress, UI, UX or by any other developer title.
            Apart from this, I love to do photo or video editing and tech blogging is one of my favourite hobbies .

            I believe that the previous works of someone cannot define his skills.
            Skills can be taught, personality is inherent. I prefer to keep learning, continue challenging myself, and do interesting things that matter.
			
      <br>  <br>    
            I am easily inspired and more then willing to follow my fascinations wherever they take me. Iâ€™m passionate, expressive, multi-talented spirit with a natural ability to entertain and inspire. 
            I am never satisfied to just come up with ideas. Instead I have an almost impulsive need to act on them.
